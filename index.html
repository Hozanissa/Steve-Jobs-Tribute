            <h2>About Steve Jobs</h2>
            <p>Steve Jobs <strong><em>(1955–2011)</em></strong> was a visionary entrepreneur, inventor, and the co-founder of <strong><em>Apple Inc</em></strong>.
               He revolutionized several industries, including personal computing, animated movies, music, phones, 
               tablet computing, and digital publishing.
               Known for his innovation and perfectionism, Jobs played a major role in making technology accessible 
               and beautifully designed for the everyday user.</p>
          
            <p>Jobs was born in <strong><em>San Francisco</em></strong> and adopted shortly after birth. 
               He dropped out of <strong><em>Reed College</em></strong> but continued auditing classes that interested him, like calligraphy —
               which later influenced the design aesthetics of Apple products. 
               In <strong><em>1976</em></strong>, along with Steve Wozniak, he started Apple Computer in his parents' garage.
               The <strong><em>Macintosh</em></strong>, <strong><em>iPod</em></strong>, <strong><em>iPhone</em></strong>, and <strong><em>iPad</em></strong> are among the many groundbreaking products created under his leadership.</p>
          
            <p>Despite being ousted from Apple in <strong><em>1985</em></strong>, Jobs returned in <strong><em>1997</em></strong> and led the company 
               back to profitability and global influence. 
               His passion for innovation, design, and user experience continues to inspire millions around the world. 
               <strong><em>Steve Jobs'</em></strong> legacy is not only in the products he created but in the way he transformed technology and culture forever.</p>
